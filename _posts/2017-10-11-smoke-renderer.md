Smoke-Renderer was a solo project for university during my bachelor's degree.
The goal was to render a cloud of smoke interacting with a solid object.

It is an implementation of two types of volume rendering: Splatting and Texture Slicing. It also implements Deep Shadow Maps to get nice-looking shadows on the solid object.

The code for this project can be found in a repository [here](https://github.com/Aldurethar/smoke-renderer).
