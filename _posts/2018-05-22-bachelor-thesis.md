Visualisierung von Subdivisionsvolumendaten (Visualizing Subdivision Volumes) was the title of my bachelor's thesis.
I wrote this thesis at Fraunhofer IGD, and the aim was to create a renderer for a specific type of volumetric data that is a generalization of Subdivision Surfaces.

The renderer transforms the Subdivision Volume data into a voxel grid and renders that with raycasting.
Because the code belongs to Fraunhofer, I can not publish it, but here is a screenshot of the final result:
