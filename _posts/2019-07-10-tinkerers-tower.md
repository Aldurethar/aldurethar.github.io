"The Tinkerer's Tower" is an adventure game createn in Unreal Engine.
It was created by my friend Anna Breunig as her bachelor's thesis in media design at University of Applied Sciences in Mainz.

She was responsible for all aspects of game design and graphics and created all the assets for the game.
My responsibilities were programming gameplay as well as doing profiling and optimizing the game scenes to make sure everything runs smoothly.
I also created a few dynamic material effects for some assets.

More details about the project and lots of screenshots can be found on [her portfolio website](https://annabreunig.de/).
This is definitely the most visually impressive project I have worked on so far (the perks of working with an artist), and I'm really proud of what we achieved.
The game was even shown at GamesCom 2019 as part of a showcase of her University.
