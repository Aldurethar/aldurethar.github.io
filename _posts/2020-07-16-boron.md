Boron is a personal project to build a small game engine.

While reading the book "Game Engine Architecture" by Jason Gregory, I decided to try building an engine myself to better understand how they work.
It was also a way to get more comfortable with using C++ and learning a clean, modern style for it in preparation for my master's.

It is quite far from anything one could call finished or usable for actual games, but it was a great learning experience and I want to continue tinkering with it.
What code there already is can be found [here](https://github.com/Aldurethar/Boron).
