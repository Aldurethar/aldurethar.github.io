My master's thesis bears the name of "Stylized Rendering in the Style of Copperplate Engravings".
As the title suggests, it focuses on rendering 3d scenes in the style of engravings and more specifically on the type of hatching that is common in this art form.

Its core is an algorithm I developed to continually update the individual hatching lines from each frame to the next to avoid flickering artifacts.
In practice, the results look something like this:

This thesis is probably the most compicated project I have done so far, and I finished it with a perfect grade of 1,0.
The code for it can be found in a repository [here](https://github.com/Aldurethar/Copperplate).
