In my three years at KAIKO, I worked on "Project 5", a top-down action adventure from a beloved THQNordic IP that sadly did not make it to release.
The game was built entirely on in-house technology, and the main part of my work was building the render in a small two-person team together with Senior Programmer Florian Eisele.
