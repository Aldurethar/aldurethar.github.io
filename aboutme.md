title: About Me
---

My name is Jan Enders, and I'm a graphics programmer from Germany.

## Interests

Apart from programming and computer graphics in general, my interests include:

- Game Engines and their architecture
- Stylized Rendering
- Game Design

## Languages

I'm a native German speaker, and am fluent in English both written and verbal.
I also learned Latin in school, although it has been a while since I found any use for it.

In terms of programming languages, I started with Java, but soon switched to C#, where I'm quite comfortable.

In the course of my studies and especially during my master's degree, I have become proficient in C++ where I strongly prefer the more modern style (C++ 11 and up) for its cleaner handling of pointers.
